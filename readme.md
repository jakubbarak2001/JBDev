REFACTOR
"Code your way out, or lose your mind trying."

REFACTOR is a dark, satirical text-based RPG set in the grim reality of Northern Bohemia. You play as a young police officer who has realized their true calling is not law enforcement, but software development.

Your mission is simple: Survive 30 days. Your goal: Refactor your life. Become a Full-Stack Developer and quit the force before the job destroys you.

🎮 Game Features
3 Core Stats to Balance:

💰 Money: You need it to survive, buy courses, and pay fines. If it hits 0, you end up homeless.

💻 Coding Skill: Your ticket out. Learn Python, solve bugs, and impress tech recruiters.

😡 PCR Hatred: A measure of your sanity. If this reaches 100%, you will suffer a mental breakdown.

30-Day Cycle: Every day brings new challenges. Manage your time between shifts, gym, therapy, and coding bootcamps.

Random Events: Deal with bureaucratic disasters, "sovereign citizens," broken printers, and corruption. Your choices matter.

Multiple Endings: Will you escape to a tech startup? Will you end up institutionalized? Or will you freeze on the streets?

Dynamic Soundtrack: Features original AI-generated atmospheric tracks.
